During my master studies in Berlin, I took a course "Hot Topics in Computer Vision" and have implemented Random Ferns for the classification of pixels in a PolSAR image based on neighbourhood features.

Some part of the code results from input that I got based on two questions I posted on https://codereview.stackexchange.com
